title: "Calculating and Using Distances between Roman Amphitheaters"
output: html_document

A quick demo of calcuating distances between points and then working with that data. Makes it through thinking of distance pairs as a network. Feel free to fork and improve.
```{r wholething, warning=FALSE, message= F}
# libraries
library(curl)
library(ggplot2)
library(igraph)
library(sp)
library(tidyr)

# load amphitheater data
library(cawd)

#generate distances of all amphitheaters to all other amphitheaters
ramphs.dists <- spDists(ramphs.sp,ramphs.sp,longlat = TRUE)

# this is in the form of a matrix
#print the distance between the Dura and Arles Amphitheaters
ramphs.dists[1,2]

# but let's use names
colnames(ramphs.dists) <- ramphs$id
rownames(ramphs.dists) <- ramphs$id

# now print distane between Arles Amphitheater and Lyon Amphitheater
ramphs.dists["arlesAmphitheater", "lyonAmphitheater"]

# we also have useless info that amphitheaters are 0Km from themselves
ramphs.dists["arlesAmphitheater", "arlesAmphitheater"]

# Would be nice to have a d.f in the form from,to,km
as.data.frame(ramphs.dists) -> ramphs.dists.df

#add column of names, in anticipation of using gather()
cbind(from = ramphs$id,ramphs.dists.df) -> ramphs.dists.df

gather(ramphs.dists.df, to, km, 2:dim(ramphs.dists.df)[2]) -> ramphs.dists.df

# data now in nice columns but...
# we still have the 0Km rows.
head(ramphs.dists.df)

#set phasers to kill...
ramphs.dists.df[ramphs.dists.df$km > 0,] -> ramphs.dists.df

# yay, they're gone
head(ramphs.dists.df)

# printing pairs is wordier than using the matrix
ramphs.dists.df$km[ramphs.dists.df$from == 'arlesAmphitheater' & ramphs.dists.df$to == 'lyonAmphitheater']
# we record both directions, that's probably not a problem but do keep it in mind
ramphs.dists.df$km[ramphs.dists.df$from == 'lyonAmphitheater' & ramphs.dists.df$to == 'arlesAmphitheater']

#reasonably straigtforward to find closest neighbor (target for improvement)
ramphs.dists.df[ramphs.dists.df$from == "duraEuroposAmphitheater",] -> tmp.df
as.character(tmp.df$to[which.min(tmp.df$km)]) # avoid extra factor output w/as.character()

# and note that we can think of this df as edges of a network
graph.data.frame(ramphs.dists.df, directed = TRUE) -> ramphs.dists.nw

# let's see groups of amphitheaters close to each other
subgraph.edges(ramphs.dists.nw, eids = E(ramphs.dists.nw)[km < 99]) -> close.amphitheaters.nw
close.amphitheaters.nw
par(mai = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(close.amphitheaters.nw,
     edge.arrow.size = 0,
     vertex.size = 2,
     vertex.label.cex = .3)

# now let's look for "close" amphitheaters with high network degree.
# those are deeply integrated into dense groupings.

degree(close.amphitheaters.nw) -> tmp.nw

set.vertex.attribute(close.amphitheaters.nw,
                     name = "degree",
                     index = V(close.amphitheaters.nw),
                     value = tmp.nw) -> close.amphitheaters.nw

summary(V(close.amphitheaters.nw)$degree)

# top quartile
summary(V(close.amphitheaters.nw)$degree)[5]

# print the top quartile
V(close.amphitheaters.nw)[degree >= summary(V(close.amphitheaters.nw)$degree)[5]]
# next up, exploring where those are (Italy, anyone?)
